A snobby, snarky little bot. A perennial work in progress.

<br />*mean-bob* is part of an (overly?) ambitious goal of creating a chat bot that will change moods from mean and snarky to kind and helpful. Imagine Data and Lore in one bot :). This is very much a work in progress, but it's a fun toy to play with when frustrated with other more significant projects or studying.
