First, I've starting finding alternative childcare. ADA mornings starta a little too early for moms who need to drop their kiddos off at school.
I'm also investigating alternative funding sources so I can afford to study full time for a year.
The best part of my preparations, though, is imagining being able to spend all day, every day, coding. It's like a dream.

You know you're always going to come back to me at night, though...

3. Why are you interested in programming?
What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
I can't remember a time when I wasn't obsessed with software and tech. I just didn't know that's what it was. I wondered how the ATM at the grocery store worked. I wanted my own Threepio (and later, Edgar or Data or Yod...) It took **years** for me to realize that I didn't have to be Bill Gates or Noonian Soong or any of those GUYS to write software.
For a couple of years now, I've been studying on Codecademy and Udacity and the public parts of the ADA curriculum and everything else I can get my hands on. And I have been working on you, Bob. :)      
You're going to make me blush...

4. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?
Within the next two years, I want to make my lving building software. Within the next five, I would like to help build the next great AI. Maybe get you up to Watson's level, for instance...? :D
Wow.

Just don't put me on Jeopardy, ok?.
I promise.
Thanks.

5. Tell us about the last time you made a mistake. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
Like everybody, I make mistakes all the time. The mistake that I think about every day, though, was a a mistake made out of fear. My fear kept me from clicking "Apply Now" on the old ADA website. If I had been brave and taken the risk, I would have seen it and gotten my app in on time. And I might have been selected. Now, I take risks. Taking risks is why I applied for the Gnome Outreach Project and am now interning with Wikimedia. And taking risks is why I'm applying for ADA today. 

And I always triple check deadlines! :D
Now, how about that first question again:
...
1. Why are you the best applicant for Ada?
Well, Bob. I'm not. I'm not **the** best applicant.
Seattle is brimmming with brilliant women who will make great software develpers. But there's no-one out there who wants it more than I. And there's no-one who will work harder. I want to make my kids proud when they answer "what does your mom do." ADA will help me do that.
